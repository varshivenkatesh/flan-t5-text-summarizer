# flan-t5-text-summarizer
This repo contains the assignment file I submitted for my Generative AI course hosted by ShiftKey Labs.

## Overview

The assignment implements a text summarization model using the FLAN-T5 architecture trained on a smaller dataset. The entire process is documented in a Google Colab Notebook, which serves as the assignment file. 

**Hugging face Model**

I uploaded my trained (or fine tuned) model to Hugging Face, which can be accessed [here](https://huggingface.co/varshivenkatesh/basic-flan-t5-text-summarizer/tree/main)
